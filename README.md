Raspbian Update for Raspberry Pi
Menu.sh uses a number of other scripts for the purpose of creating a single menu driven script for updating Raspbian for the Raspberry Pi
The code is largely taken from other publicly available code and presented as part of a single solution for updates which was not available in January 2018.
